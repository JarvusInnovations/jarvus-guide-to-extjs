# Git Submodules

[Git Submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules) allow you to clone other git repositories anywhere within your project's repository. You can check out any branch from the submodule's repository, but you get the entire contents of that branch added to your tree as-is -- you can't pick-and-choose what files and directories get pulled.

The benefit of using submodules vs just copying the repository into your tree manually is that with submodules the files don't actually get copied into your repository. Instead, only the configuration for cloning the repository and the hash of the commit you want to use get saved into your repository. This ensures that any developer checking out a given commit within your project's repository will always get the same exact version of the submodule's files too as the author of that commit had them.

From the perspective of your project's git repository, the path in your tree where the submodule is mounted just looks like a text file containing a commit hash. When you `cd` into the submodules directory with your shell or open it with a GUI application, git will behave as if you were in that other repository. If you make changes to any files within the submodule you need to commit and push them to the submodule repository first. Whenever the `HEAD` commit for the submodule changes -- either from making a new commit, checking out a new branch, or pulling updates -- a change with the new commit hash shows up to be staged in the main project repository. The change to the submodule `HEAD` can be committed to your project's repository on its own, or logically bundled with other changes as you would any other edit.

## Using Submodules in your Sencha Workspace

Submodules are a great way to add Sencha frameworks and packages to your project.

### Switching Existing Framework

If you generated your application with Sencha CMD it may have copied a minimal framework tree into your app or workspace. These are safe to replace with the full framework trees provided by any archive distributed by Sencha or mirrors of such checked into git.

As with any change to your project you want to start from a clean working tree. It is best to make the change entirely in one discreet commit so that each commit in your history is fully functional, and the commit for switching the framework to a submodule can be easily merged between branches.

#### Step 1: Remove `.gitignore` Patterns

If you've previously used `.gitignore` patterns to exclude frameworks from version control you'll want to start your commit by deleting any such patterns. This command run from the root of your project's repository may help you find them:

```bash
grep -H ext `find . -name ".gitignore"`
```

#### Step 2a: Delete Untracked Framework

If you were ignoring the framework and not tracking it in your repository then you now just need to delete the files from your working tree:

```bash
rm -R ./sencha-workspace/ext-6.0.0.640/
```

#### Step 2b: Delete Tracked Framework

Otherwise, if you *were* tracking the framework's files in your repository you'll need to use git's `rm` command instead to both remove the files from your working tree **and** mark them for deletion in your commit:

```bash
git rm -r ./sencha-workspace/ext-6.0.0.640/
```

#### Step 3: Add Submodule

With the path for the framework in your working tree clear and ready to be tracked by git, you can now clone the framework as a submodule into the same path you had it before. In this example we will use a public repository maintained on GitHub by [Jarvus Innovations](http://jarv.us) that mirrors all the GPL releases of Sencha frameworks with convenient branch names added at varying levels of specificity. You could of course use any remote or local repository of your choosing, hosted privately or publically. If you're using a commercially-licensed framework you should commit it yourself to your own private repository to share between projects internally.

```bash
git submodule add --name ext-6.0.1.250 -b 6.0.1.250 https://github.com/JarvusInnovations/extjs.git ./sencha-workspace/ext-6.0.1.250
```

After the `submodule add` command completes successfully, two new changes will be staged to your pending commit. One adds the mount path, clone URL, and branch name to a file called `.gitmodules` in the root of your repository. The other adds a file at that mount point containing text like `Subproject commit bb1821f030041ac6d63079258515bdaf8672ce7a` marking the exact current `HEAD` for the branch. These two bits of information will give anyone cloning this commit all they need to both reproduce the same exact tree and have the means to exchange updates with the source repository.

#### Step 4: Commit Changes

At this point, your `git status` output should look something like this if your framework was previously kept untracked with a `.gitignore` pattern (trade the `.gitignore` modification with the deletion of the framework tree otherwise):

```
âš¡ git status
On branch develop
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/develop'.
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)

	modified:   .gitignore
	modified:   .gitmodules
	new file:   sencha-workspace/ext-6.0.1.250
```

Take note of any changes you made manually in additional to documenting the command you ran to add the submodule in your commit message:

```bash
git commit -m 'Add ext-6.0.1.250 as submodule

Removed .gitignore pattern manually and used command:

    git submodule add --name ext-6.0.1.250 -b 6.0.1.250 https://github.com/JarvusInnovations/extjs.git ./sencha-workspace/ext-6.0.1.250'
```

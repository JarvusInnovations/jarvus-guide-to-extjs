# Fixing a Bug

- Create an override
- Do not add features to the framework, only correct the framework not working as documented or clearly intended
- Document the fiddle that proves the bug
- Link to the forum post that reports the bug
- If you need to copy a function body from the framework, break into separate commits copying the function as-is and applying the corrections to it. In the commit for the original body, document exactly what release it came from.

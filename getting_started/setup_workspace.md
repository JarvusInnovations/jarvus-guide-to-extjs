## Step 1: Initialize git repository

If you haven't already, initialize a new git repository to track your changes. Using git and keeping a good account of your changes is essential to a well-built and maintained Sencha project.

```bash
mkdir -p ~/Repositories/my-project
cd ~/Repositories/my-project
git init
```
